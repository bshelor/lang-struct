Implementations
================


Perl RegEx Recognizer
--------------------------------

I started working on this implementation by considering how to take input in from a file in Perl.  I have
never programmed in Perl before, so this was a new endeavor.  I then began to refresh myself on RegEx, having not used it
in multiple years, and began to process how to split up the string of each line.

I tried to split up valid references into sections and tackle the expression that way.  This proved to be more
difficult than I was expecting, as certain RegEx syntax and behavior was unfamiliar to me.  After some long hours, I was
able to figure out a decent way to split up the different options that were possible in a Bible reference, and then I spit
out the results (Match or No Match) to the console.

Below is a screenshot of the execution:

### Note
I was able to get the extra credit match of `Matt 2:3-3:1` to work!!

Pictured below:

C: Recursive Descent Parser
--------------------------------

I was unable to spend time on this implementation.

Java: ANTLR + Java Code in IntelliJ Project

I was unable to spend time on this implementation.


Assignment Reflection
======================

Hours to complete assignment: 6

I did not start early enough on this assignment.  Due to a lot extenuating circumstances with my schedule,
I was unable to complete the entire assignment.  While I was incredibly busy, I did not properly apportion my time
or communicate with the professor to figure out a solution for this.  Next time I will communicate further ahead of time
if I know I will not have the time to complete the assignment.

That being said, I spent all of Sunday on the Perl regex recognizer.  I found it pretty difficult to determine a working
implementation of this.  I am not super satisfied with my solution, but it does work.  I did not really enjoy the work that
I did on this assignment.
