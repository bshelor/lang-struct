Implementations
================


Recursive Descent Parser
--------------------------------

To run this file, navigate to your command line and type in the following:
~~~~~~~~~~~ Python
python rdp.py rdp_input.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~

I created this program in Python. As you can see, I take the input from a file.  After parsing through this input, I display
the proper Postfix format on standard output. (See below)

![My Python RDP program running against an input file](./rdp_working.png)

I was able to store the line numbers of where the variables first appeared, and I display
that with my symbolTable dump.  Other than that, this program runs pretty standard and displays
the output in the proper postfix format.

My implementation was written in Python and uses a lot of recursion and dictionaries.  I have multiple
dictionaries that store iteration information, the tokenized input, and the symbol table.  This might not
be the most efficient tactic, but it gets the job done.  I can basically add infinite amount of information
that I want for each token, as each one is stored as its own dictionary.

This was quite difficult for me.  It was tough for me to conceptualize the recursive nature of this
program.  Translating the grammar into code proved to be very hard and time consuming.  I spent 13 hours on 
this 1/3 of the project alone.  Not good.  But I was able to power through and finish, and it feels good!
I feel like I have a much better understanding of how this kind of thing works, and I think this will help
me a lot with the group project.  Wrestling with the hard problems will allow me to be more effective in 
similar situations in the future.


ANTLR: Recognizer with Actions for Translation
--------------------------------

For this implementation, I chose to define my ANTLR grammar and define actions along with this grammar.
Each time a certain sequence is matched, the program will then print out the proper character in post-fix
format.  This program, then, effectively recognizes proper input and properly translates this input from in-fix
notation to post-fix.

Below is a screenshot of my grammar and java code:

This part of the assignment was not terribly difficult, as spending so much time on the RDP gave me a good understanding
of how the grammar was working.  I got this done fairly quickly, and implemented it in a pretty standard way.

ANTLR with Listener/Visitor
--------------------------------

I chose to not complete this implementation as I had already reached full credit with extra credit points.
I did the line numbers for the Python implementation of RDP.

Assignment Reflection
======================

Hours to complete assignment: 13 (RDP), 3 (ANTLR) --- 16 total

I enjoyed this assignment.  Spending so much time on RDP gave me a deep understanding of how the recursive nature
of lexer analysis works.  I am much more comfortable with grammar and parsing now, which is a good thing.  I think this assignment
allowed us to wrestle with the toughness of recursion while gaining a better understanding of parsing.  

I want to note that I did complete the extra credit portion of storing the line numbers for the symbol table.
