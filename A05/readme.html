Haskell Functions
================

prods
--------------------------------

Code for this implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
prods :: Int -> [Int]
prods n = [n*n, (n*n)+n ..]
~~~~~~~~~~~

I tested this function with the following code inside my main:
~~~~~~~~~~~
let prodsList = prods 5
    printList prodsList
~~~~~~~~~~~

And it resulted in the following output.  As we can see this is an infinite list incrementing by 5's.

mix
--------------------------------

Code for this implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
mix :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
mix [] [] = []
mix xs [] = xs
mix [] ys = ys
mix (x:xs) (y:ys) = do
    if x == y then do 
        x : (mix xs ys)
    else if x < y then do 
        x : (mix xs (y:ys))
    else
        y : (mix (x:xs) ys)
~~~~~~~~~~~

I tested functionality with the following code inside my main:
~~~~~~~~~~~
let finalList = mix [1,3,5,8] [2,3,4,7,9]
    printList finalList
~~~~~~~~~~~

Which resulted in the following output.  The list is sorted as it should be.

sieve
--------------------------------

Code for this implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
sieve :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
sieve [] ys = []
sieve (x:xs) ys = do
    let addProdsList = prods x
    let mixList = mix ys addProdsList in
        if inList x ys == False then do
            let ys = mixList in
                x : (sieve xs ys)
        else
            let ys = mixList in
                sieve xs ys
~~~~~~~~~~~

With a helper function to solve the problem.
~~~~~~~~~~~
inList :: Int -> [Int] -> Bool
inList n [] = False
inList n (x:xs)
    | n == x = True
    | n < x = False
    | otherwise = inList n xs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Tested with the following code:
~~~~~~~~~~~
let finalList = sieve [2..7] []
    printList finalList
~~~~~~~~~~~

Expecting to see a list of the first 4 prime numbers, here was our result. 
![Successful run of sieve function. First 4 prime numbers (2,3,5,7)](./sieve_run.png)


firstn
--------------------------------

Code for this implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
firstn :: Int -> [Int]
firstn n = do
    let primesList = sieve [2..] [] in
        concatToLimit n primesList []
~~~~~~~~~~~

With a helper function to solve the problem.
~~~~~~~~~~~
concatToLimit :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
concatToLimit limit (x:xs) zs 
    | length zs == limit = zs
    | otherwise = concatToLimit limit xs (zs++[x])
~~~~~~~~~~~

Tested with the following code:
~~~~~~~~~~~
let finalList = firstn 6
    printList finalList
~~~~~~~~~~~

We expect to see the first 6 prime numbers, and here was our result:
![First 6 prime numbers correctly printed out](./firstn_run.png)


primesto
--------------------------------

Code for this implementation:
~~~~~~~~~~~
primesto :: Int -> [Int]
primesto 1 = []
primesto n = sieve [2..n] []
~~~~~~~~~~~


Tested with the following code:
~~~~~~~~~~~
let finalList = primesto 30
    printList finalList
~~~~~~~~~~~

We expect to see all prime numbers up to 30, and here is our result:
![All prime numbers under 30](./primesto_run.png)

Assignment Reflection
======================

Hours to complete assignment: 4

I really enjoyed this assignment!  I honestly like haskell quite a bit.  While I don't know how much I'll use it in the future,
it gives me a good experience in learning about the power of recursion for looping operations.  Haskell forces you to do that a lot
to solve problems, so this was a good practice for that.
